Concise, modular implementation of Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08055

This is my most starred implementation on GitHub. I wrote this in a couple hours when normally I work 36+ hours straight on my repositories. While the model is accurate to the end, the model does not successfully do anything and the paper's results are bullshit.
